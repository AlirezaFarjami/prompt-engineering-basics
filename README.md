## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Steps to set up:**
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root
2. Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Add the key to your `.env` file as shown above
4. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to keep your API key secure

**Note:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control as it contains sensitive information.
